# soundnode
A Home Automation sensor that monitors certain sound patterns and publishes results to a MQTT topic.

A common problem for some folks is that they live in a place where they can't modify the existing residence. So this sound node can be used for things like smoke alarms, water alarms, CO alarms and the dryer.

This node can be used to monitor for sound patterns or levels.
